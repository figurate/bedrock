/**
 * # AWS ECR Roles
 *
 * Purpose: Provision IAM roles in AWS.
 *
 * Rationale: Bedrock blueprints use IAM roles to restrict the privileges of the provisioner.
 *
 * This script will create a role that has the following privileges:
 *
 * * Access for managing ECR repositories specific to this blueprint
 * * Access to read/write Terraform state associated with the account
